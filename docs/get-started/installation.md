## Installation

To get started with cybermod, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install cybermod
```

Or poetry:

```bash
poetry add cybermod
```

Or rye:

```bash
rye add cybermod
```

!> cybermod requires pyrogram to be installed, since it's a plugin that only does monkeypatching, rather than a standalone fork of pyrogram.
